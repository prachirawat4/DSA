Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository!
This repo contains my personal solutions to a wide range of DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.
The goal of this repository is to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and build an optimized approach to tackling coding challenges.

ðŸš€ Platforms Covered

LeetCode ðŸŸ¡ â€“ Problems focusing on data structures, algorithms, and interview preparation.

Codeforces ðŸ”µ â€“ Competitive programming problems to enhance speed and logic under time pressure.

ðŸ“š Topics Covered

This repository includes problems from various core DSA concepts such as:

Arrays and Strings

Linked Lists

Stacks and Queues

Trees and Binary Search Trees

Heaps and Priority Queues

Recursion and Backtracking

Dynamic Programming

Graphs and Shortest Paths

Greedy Algorithms

Bit Manipulation

Sliding Window and Two Pointers
